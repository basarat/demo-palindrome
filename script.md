# Algorithm to determine if a string is a palindrome
> A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward, for example, radar, toot, and madam. In this lesson we discuss how to approach the palindrome problem as an algorithmist.

```js
/**
 * A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward, for example, radar, toot, and madam.
 * - Write a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome.
 */
```

* We will start by creating our isPalindrome function 

```js
function isPalindrome(s1: string) {
}
```
